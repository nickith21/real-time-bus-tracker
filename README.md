# Real Time Bus Tracker

# Title of the project:
Real Time Bus Tracker

# Description of the project: 
This project displays the locations of a selection of MBTA buses on a map through the Mapbox API. After opening this file, it will reload automatically every 100 seconds and pull new information about the bus locations. The was origionally set up with a street view and I refactored the code to include a terrain style, adding a feature to zoom in and zoom out of the map.

# How to Run:
* Clone this repo
* Open the index.html file in a browser

# Roadmap of future improvements:
* Adding a line to the map to show each bus route
* Adding ability to click on a bus marker and view more details about it
